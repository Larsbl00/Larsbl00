# Hello There ü§ñ‚öîÔ∏èüßë

I love learning about the entire software lifecycle.
Ranging from architecture and design all the way to validation and deployment.
I am happiest when I get to do bit of all;
switching between perspectives allows me get a better understanding
of what I am working on. Leading to a much high quality.

## Highlighted Projects

I like to spend time to explore now concepts and technology
through the use of smaller projects.
This often means these projects have a narrow scope.
Consequentially, I am much more focussed getting things into a working state
compared to writing production code.
